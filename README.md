# Overview
I examined the Spotify music dataset using SQL to understand its structure, quality, and key patterns. The dataset contains over 20,000+ tracks with a mix of artist and track metadata, Spotify audio features, and YouTube/Spotify engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, and streams. Using SQL queries, I performed data validation by checking data types, missing values, and duplicates, followed by exploratory analysis using aggregations, filtering, and window functions. This helped identify top-performing artists and tracks, compare album versus single performance, analyze platform-wise popularity (Spotify vs YouTube), and evaluate how audio features relate to audience engagement. Overall, SQL enabled efficient exploration and insight generation from a large, structured music dataset, demonstrating strong data analysis and querying skills.

#Objective
* Systematically examine the structure, completeness, and reliability of the Spotify music dataset using SQL.
* Evaluate the performance of artists, tracks, and albums through quantitative analysis of streaming and engagement metrics.
* Leverage advanced SQL techniques, including aggregations and window functions, to generate rankings and trend-based insights.
* Extract meaningful insights by analyzing platform-wise performance and the relationship between audio features and audience engagement.
